# React Bricks starter with Next.js with Tailwind CSS and React Bricks UI

Kick-start your project with this boilerplate for a complete Next.js website based on [React Bricks](https://reactbricks.com), with both the front-end and admin dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

We suggest that you use the CLI and choose this starter.  
In this way you will have the credentials already set up in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
npx create-reactbricks-app
# or
yarn create reactbricks-app
```

Otherwise you can directly clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reactbricks/nextjs-starter-reactbricks-tailwind your-project
```

## Create new bricks

If you want new custom bricks to use in your `http://localhost:3000/admin/editor` you need to add it into
react-bricks > bricks folder, import into `index.ts` and you will see the new component in the playground
## ðŸ“– Documentation

Deploy on Vercel: https://reactbricks.com/learn/deploy/vercel (using a vercel hook in the project you can deploy any change in the admin editor going to settings and pressing `Deploy to Production` button)
Please, read our documentation at [Reactbricks.com](https://reactbricks.com).
